6 . EAS? LATIN FOR SJGHT READING.

d. The first word in a sentence is always conspicuous
in interest and importance. Very often it is a noun, pro-
noun, or phrase referring to the preceding sentence or to
some part of it ε

ld curn frfistrfl saepe fecisset, etc. , Here id refers to
what has been described in the foregoing sentence.

e. The most important word or combination of words
is often taken out from a subordinate introductory
sentence and placed at the very beginning before the
connective introducing that sentence. This order is
especially common with cum clauses of time and cause.
The word or phrase thus made emphatic is often such as
has been described in d above:

Latin us dum ad Tiberim descendit, sacerdos bovem
immolavit.

In quem postquam omnium Era conversa sunt, ad
finum omnes Scipionem in Hispania proconsulem
esne iusserunt.

Quae rb's' cum iuveni Pompeio cssnanti niintiita
esset, etc,

s. When a word serves as the common subject or
object of both a principal and subordinate clause, it
stands before them both. The same is true, if the same
word is‘subject of the principal clause and object (direct
or indirect) of the subordinate clause. Likewise if the
subject of the subordinate clause is the object (direct or
indirect) of the principal clause. (Cf. Menge's Repeti·

torium, 543.)

Ancus', priusquam eis bellum indiceret, legatum
misit, A neus, before lte declared war against them,
sent an ambassador.
