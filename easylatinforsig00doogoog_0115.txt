LUCIUS AEMILIUS PAULUS MACEDONICUS.
168 B.c.

Aemilius Paulus was one of the best specimens of the Roman nobility.
He would condescena' to no mean action to win personal advantage. He was

a model soldier and an astute lawyer, and throughout his life won the admira·

tion of all classes by the purity and integrity of his character. He was born
about 230 B.c.; died 160 ΒΩ. His greatest achievement, which gave ht'm his
cognomen, was his victory over Perseus, K ing of Macedonia, in his second

consulship (168 B.c.). His triumph was the most splendid that Rome had
yet seen.
