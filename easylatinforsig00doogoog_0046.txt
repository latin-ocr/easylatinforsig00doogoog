HERCULES.

Hercules, a Greek hero celebrated for his great strength, was pursued
throughout his life by the hatred ofJuno. While yet an infant, he strangled
some serpents sent by the goddess to destroy him. During his boyhood and
youth he performed various marvelous feats of strength ,· and, on reaching
manhood, succeeded in delivering the Thebans from the oppression of the
Minyae. In a fit of madness, sent upon him by Iuno, he slew his own
children, and, on consulting the Delphic oracle as to how he should cleanse
himself from this crime, he was ordered to submit himself for twelve years
to Eurystheus, king of Tiryns, and to perform whatever tasks were appointed
him. Hercules obeyed the oracle, and during the twelve years of his ser-
vitude accomplished twelve extraordinary feats known as the Labors of
Hercules. His death was caused, unintentionally‚ by his wife Deianira.
Hercules had shot with his poisoned arrows a Centaur named Nessus, who
had insulted Deianira. Nessus, before he died, gave some of his blood to
Deianira, and told her it would act as a charm to secure her husband’s love.
Some time after, Deianira, wishing to try the charm, soaked one of her hus-
band's garments in the blood, not knowing that it was poisoned. Hercules

put on the robe, and, after suffering terrible torments‚ died, or was carried
off by his father Jupiter.
