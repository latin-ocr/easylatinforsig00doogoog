 

EASY LATIN FOR SIGHT READING.

——m—

INTRODUCTION.

Ι. What is Sight Reading?

By sight reading is meant the ability to read and un-
derstand Latin in the order in which it stands, without
formal translation and without slavish dependence upon
grammar and dictionary. If a translation be required, it
should come as a subsequent exercise in English after
the thought of the Latin is already clear. Sight reading
does not mean inexact and rapid skimming over of a
Latin text. In acquirin'g the power to read at sight, we
proceed at first slowly‚ afterwards with greater speed‚ to
an exact and accurate comprehension of the language.

ΙΙ. What are the Difficulties?

The difficulties are not so great as is usually supposed. .
Constant 'practice and persistent effort along right meth-
ods together with a thorough knowledge of the essentials
of Latin grammar are all that is required. The three
chief obstacles that hinder the student's progress through
a Latin sentence are his deficient vocabulary‚ his unfa-
miliarity with the constructions, and the unusual order of
the words and clauses.
