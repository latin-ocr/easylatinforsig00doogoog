Sometimes, however, a modifying genitive stands between
cum and its object. If cum be a conjunction, it may be
a mere⁴ connective, correlative with a following tum, or
it may introduce a subordinate clause and mean since,
although, or when. If it introduces a subordinate clause
and means since or although, it is followed by the sub—
junctive. If it means when, the following mood will
be indicative, in case the tense be present or future3
if the tense be past, the mood will probably be sub—
junctive.

5. Dum, diinec, and quoad, in the sense of while or as
long as, take the indicative mood. In the sense of until,
. when expressing purpose, doubt, or futurt‘zy, they take the
subjunctive.

6. Antequam and priusquam, when referring to an
anticipated or intended act which may or may not occur,

take the subjunctive. When they refer to the actual
occurrence of an event as a point beyond or back of which
the main event took place, they take the indicative : .
