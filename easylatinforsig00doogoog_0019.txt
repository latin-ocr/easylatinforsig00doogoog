fUL Porto 1 ta incidit ut οδ ipso tompore Hasdrubal ad

eundem portum appelleret, perckance it so happened
that at tlzat very time Hasdrubal lauded at tlte same
barber.

Tam longe aberam ut. eum non viderem, I was sofar

subject often stands between them:

M& Amani ducem crefiverunt, tlte A lbans elected me
general.
