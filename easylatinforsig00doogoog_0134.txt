1. Cn. Naevius, 270-204 B.C.‚
a famous epic and dramatic poet.
Of his epic poem on the First
Punic War a few fragments still
remain. It was extensively copied
by later writers, especially by Ver-
gil. His plays were very popu-
lar even in the Augustan age.

2. T. Maccius PlautuS‚ born
about 2 54 B.c.‚ was the most
celebrated comic poet of Rome.
We still possess twenty of his

plays.

3. M. Pacuvius, one of the
early Roman tragedians, was
born about 220 13.c. He was
equally famous as a painter and
as a writer. A few fragments of
his plays are extant.
