14 EASY-LATJN FOR SIGHT READING.

4. The Aumatium

a. The name of a town or domus or rfis, in the accusa-
tive without a preposition, probably designates the object
to which motion is directed.

b. The name of a person, or a word referring to per-
sonS, in the accusative case without a preposition, must
be either the object of a verb, the subject or predicate of
an infinitive‚ or in apposition with one of these.

c. As accusatives of specification are found most com-
monly: the relative quod3 the interrogative quid 3 hoc
and id with aetatis or temporis3 partem, vicem, and
genus with omne or a pronoun.

d. Accusatives of time and space are naturally limited
to such nouns as can convey such ideaS, eg„ pedES,
mense& etc.

e. Cognate accusatives are possible only for nouns that
repeat in substantive form the meaning of a verb, eg„

vita, somnium, etc.; and for neuter pronouns and adjec-
tives.

5 . ne A blative.

a. The ablative case includes three ideas from which
all its constructions flow, viz. .· the starting point (the true
ablative, from), the means (the instrumental, by), and the
place (the locative‚ in).

b. N early all ablatives can be absolute, or can depend
on a comparative or on a special word like dignus or
litor. The meaning of the word is a great help in
suggesting the correct construction.
