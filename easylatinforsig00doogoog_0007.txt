THIS little book is put forth with the hope that it will
lead to more sight reading in secondary schools. While
theoretically all agree that nothing is more helpful and
inspiring, practically but few give it the attention it de-
serveS. When sight reading is made to mean loose guess·
ing and inexact interpretation of Latin as a refuge from
hard study and scholarly habits, nothing can be urged in
its defense 3 but properly understood as a method by which
one may be safely and surely led to read and understand
Latin as Latin, to take in its thoughts easily in the order
in which they are presented, with no conscious appeal to
English, we must all acknowledge its primary importance.

Poor results in the study of Latin are largely due to mis-
directed energy. Students learn much about the language‚
but do not learn the language itself. They get the form, but
not the substance. While no language can be learned with-
out knowing its grammar and syntax, the amount of such
knowledge that is necessary to one who seeks only the mean-
ing οἱ the text is much smaller than is often supposed; and
however valuable close grammatical analysis may be for
other purposes‚ it may, and no doubt often doeS‚ seriously
impede progress towards rapid reading and intelligent appre-
ciation. The man who parsed Milton's “ Paradise Lost''
