PERSEUS.

Acrisius, an ancient king os Argos, had been warned by an oracle that
he would perish by the hand os his grandson. On discovering, therefore,
that his daughter Danae had given birth to a son, Acrisius endeavored to
escape his fate by casting both mother and child adrifl on the sea. They
were saved, however, by the help of Jupiter; and Perseus, the child, grew up
at the court of Polydectes, king of Seriphos, an island in the Aegean Sea.
On reaching manhood, Perseus was sent by Polydectes to fetch the head of
Medusa, one of the Gorgons. This dangerous task he accomplished with
the help of Apollo and Minerva, and on his way home he rescued Androm·
eda (daughter of Cepheus) from a sea monster. Perseus then married
Andromeda, aud lived some time in the country of Cepheus. At length,
however, he returned to Seriphos, and turned Polydectes to stone by showing
him the Gorgon’s head ‚· he then went to the court of Acrisius, who fled in
terror at the news os his grandson’s return. The oracle was duly fulfilled,
for Acrisius was accidentally killed by a quoit thrown by Perseus.
