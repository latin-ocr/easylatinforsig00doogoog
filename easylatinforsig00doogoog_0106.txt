MARCUS PORCIUS CATO.
234-149 B.c.

Cato is one of the best-known and most striking figures of Roman history,
being famous as a soldier, as a civil magistrate, and as a writer. In every
respect he was a typical Roman of the old days. As a soldier he won renown
in the Second Punic War. His hostility to Carthage was unrelenting and
has become proverbial. He distinguished himself in civil affairs, especially
by his censorship. He stood for all that was simple, frugal, and virtuous
against the growing luxury and corruption of the time, and administered
his office so rigorously that the name of Censor has clung to him to this day.
Cato wrote on history and agriculture, and is among the earliest writers of
Latin prose.
