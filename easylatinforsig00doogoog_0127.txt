NOCTES ATTICAE. 107

collection of quotationS‚ discussions, and dissertations on a great
variety of subjects, mainly grammar, philosophy, history, and biog-
raphy.

Noctes Atticae has a fourfold value:

a. As a story book. Gellius says that one object of his book was
to entertain his children. It is therefore written in a popular vein,
and contains but little that is abstruse or technical.

b. As a source of information. Gellius gives much interesting
information on a great variety of subjects which, but for him, would
never have been so clearly understood.

c. As giving quotations from authors no longer extant. It is in

this respect that Noctes Atu'cae is peculiarly valuable.
² d. As a biographer of prominent writers. In this field Gellius
has done much, eg„ nearly all we know about Plautus is from this
source.

The style of Noctes Atticae is good in general, but it is marred by
an affectation towards out-of·the-way and obsolete words and phrases.
Gellius here is simply following the literary fashion of his day. It
is this same love ofs the archaic that causes him to ignore the Roman
writers that lived nearest to his own time. He scarcely mentions
the writers of the Augustan age, but speaks in the highest terms of

Plautus, Ennius, Cato, and other early writers, and quotes from
them constantly.
