ration, whatever he may have learned of formal grammar.
Students can never really enter the field of Latin literature
nor read it widely and appreciatively who cannot understand

for translation at sight is mostly meat too strong for young
beginners. Latin that is too hard is worse than useleSS‚
and leads to nothing but discouragement and seli-deprecia-

for the entire preparatory course. It is hoped that, far from
being an added burden to students already overworked, the
