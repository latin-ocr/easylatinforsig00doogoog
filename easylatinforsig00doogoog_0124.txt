Ι. LIFE OF AULus GELLmS.

All the information that we have about Gellius is contained in
his well-known work, Noctes Atticae. In this he now and then
makes incidental reference to himself and his activities‚ but nowhere
gives any express or detailed account of his life. The date of his
birth and of his death are equally uncertain, but we know from his
references to his contemporaries that he must have lived from about
120 to 18o A.D. He was probably a Roman and of good family, and
his education in grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy was of the very
best. Among his teachers may be mentioned Sulpicius Apollinaris,
the grammarian, a famous Carthaginian‚ who inspired him with a
lasting interest in his art; Titus Castricius, the foremost rhetorician
of his time; and Favorinus, the philosopher, once the favorite of
the Emperor Hadrian, and distinguished for his learning and elo-
quence. Gellius was a lawyer by profession, but found time for
much reading and study. Probably at the suggestion of Favorinus,
he made a journey to Greece and traveled extensively in that coun-
try, remaining for a considerable time at Athens. It was there, in
a country house near the city, during the long nights of winter,
that he prepared his book. This suggested its title Noctes Atticae.
No subsequent events of his life are known to us.

Gellius tells us in his preface that it was his habit when reading
to make notes and extracts from the volume before him, and that
these make up his book. It is, therefore, a note-book, containing
the concentrated results of years of study. Of the twenty books of
his work, all have come down to us excepting the eighth. There is
no atteinpt made to classify the contents, but it is a miscellaneous
