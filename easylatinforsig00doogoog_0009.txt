· From considerable experience with classes in sight reading
and from the experience and publications of others, I have
compiled and formulated in a few introductory pages some
hints and suggestions that I have found most useful‚ practi-
cally, in teaching the art of reading Latin. These are fol-
lowed by a few models for written lessons‚ which will be of
some use in fixing the foregoing suggestions. In these I
have followed, in the main, the method which Prof. W. G.
Hale describes in his well-known pamphlet, “ The Art of
Reading Latin.'' While Professor Hale's method is admir-
able in many respectS, it is possible for less skillful teachers
to overdo the science to the detriment of the art, i.e., to per-
plex the mind with unnecessary questions as to possible or
probable constructions that only delay the successful prog-
ress of the interpretation. I do not, therefore, think it well
to continue such close analysis by written work, after the
fundamental principles of Latin order and syntax have been
well mastered.

The text of the selections from Viri Romae is that of
Holzer's tenth edition (Stuttgart, 1889); Hertz (LeipsiC,
1886) has been followed in those from Gellius, For the
material frorn Fabulae Faciles, I am indebted to Mr. F.
Ritchie, of Seven Oaks, England, who kindly placed his
excellent little book at my disposal. Barring a few simpli-
fications, and some modifications in orthography and punc-
tuation, the texts have been followed without variation.
As authority for quantities the last edition (1895) of Lewis'
Elementary Latin Dictionary has been followed, as the most
widely adopted, if not in all cases the best standard.
