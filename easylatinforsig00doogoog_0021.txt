IV. Notes on Individual Words and Construc-
tions.

1. ⁸Latin expresses loosely by means of participles all

sorts of relations that are expressed in English by sub-

l ordinate clauseS. The particular relation must be deter-
³ mined by the context.

2. Expect to find many more cases of apposition

Ι than in English. An appositive often takes the place

of:

ι a. A temporal clause.

1 eicere-2 puer Arpini vixit, Cicera, when he was a boy,
ἱ lived at Arpinum.

b. A concessive clause.

Labieno legat-,6 milites n6n parent, the soldz'ers do not
obey Labienus, although lte is lieutenant.

c. A relative clause.

ἰ Externus timor, maximum concordiae vinculum,
1 etc., sear without, which is the strongest hond qs
unum.

¹⁹ 3. Clauses capable of being used as the subject or the
Ι object of a verb are ε

I. Infinitive ClauseS, or Indicative Clauses with
quod in statements of fact.
ΙΙ. Indirect QuestionS.
111. Purpose ClauseS.
IV. Result Clauses,

4. Cum is either a preposition or a conjunction. The
following word will usually determine its character. If
that be a noun in the ablative case, cum is a preposition.
