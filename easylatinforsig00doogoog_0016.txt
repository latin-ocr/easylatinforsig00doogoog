⁴ ' EASY LATJN FOR SJGHT READING.

are preceded or accompanied by invariable signsthat are
soon learned, if attention be called to them. Alertness
of mind and a little common sense, assisted by the con—
text, often lead one to the correct interpretation without
any special thought of the construction. To know the
name of a construction is no help in itself to the, correct
interpretation. The more we read and the more easily
we do SO, the less we consider constructions as such,
though, of course, we of necessity give the proper force
to each case and mood in interpreting the thought.
Construing is, therefore, not an end in itself, but should .
be merely the means to the end, namely, the interpreta-
tion of the Latin. When overdone and perfunctory, as it
often is, it retards rather than assists a pupil's progress
in reading Latin. Some special hints on construction
are given later on under a separate heading.

C. ORDER or· WoRDS.

The difficulty that appears most formidable to begin-
ners is the strangeness of the Latin order. Perfect
familiarity with the Roman ways of constructing sen-
tences is, however, an absolute essential to easy reading.
The strangeness of the order is often more apparent than
real. Examples of the periodic structure and of inverted
order are not uncommon in English and are readily
understood, e.g., “Whom ye ignorantly worship, him
declare I unto you.''

“ Up from the meadows rich with corn,
Clear in the cool September morn,
The clustered towers of Frederick stand.”
