INTRODUCTJON. 5

One reason, and perhaps the principal one, why we
find sentences such as these so difficult in Latin is that
we try to get the Latin thought in fragments by reading
and translating bits of the sentence at a time, instead
of reading it all straight through and thus getting the
complete thought in one effort of the mind as we do in
English.

A peculiarity of Latin style that is often conspicuouS,
’ and one that is of great assistance in interpretation, is
that ''the thoughts generally move by antitheses, These
contrasts are carefully marked by the order of the words
and by particleS. By noticing these, you can anticipate
the course of the thought.

The following brief summary of important points on
order and style may be found helpful:

a. To read a language the words must be taken exactly
as they come.

b. Read a sentence straight through before you try to
translate any of it. As you read, carry along in thought
the meanings of the wordS, whether vague or definite to

your mind, and their probable office, so far as the prog-
ress of the sentence enables you to do SO. Keep the
mind expectant until the close of the sentence settles all
doubtful points, Try to grasp the meaning of the sen-
tence as a whole. If you do not succeed the first time,
read it again and again until you think you get the
thought.

c. Latin aims to keep the same subject throughout a
complex sentence. When the subject is changed, that
fact is usually made plain by inserting· it or a pronoun
referring to it.
