MODELS FOR WRITTEN LESSONS.

To THE TEACHER.

The following exercises are intended to fix more firmly
in mind the preceding principles of order and syntax.
They should be used at convenient intervals and without
previous announcement or preparation, The passage for
translation should be written on the board, and each ques-
tion should be answered as it occurs before the pupil
goes farther. Do not write more of the sentence than
precedes the respective questions until they are answered.
Teachers may find it profitable to prepare additional
exercises on the models here presented.
