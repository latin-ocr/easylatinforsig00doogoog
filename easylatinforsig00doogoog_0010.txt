vi PREFA CE.

The notes consist 5¹¹, the main of synonyms, antonymS‚
and Latin paraphrases and definitionS. In these the words
used are such as are common in Caesar, Cicer0, and Vergil,
the aim being to increase the student's vocabulary and
thereby his ability to read those authors. English transla-
tions are given only where no happy and easy Latin equiva-
lent suggested itself.

It is suggested that teachers make frequent use of the
selections for oral reading. Our methods of teaching are
apt to neglect the ear, a most powerful instrument in the
interpretation of thought, and to train the eye only. Often
good students will fail to understand the simplest Latin
when it is read to them. These selections will be found of
about the right difficulty for this important discipline.

Full and grateful acknowledgment is made to all who
have added to the value of these pages by their publications
in this field. Many helpful suggestions have been drawn
from these sourceS. Special ‘thanks are due to Dr. John
Tetlow, head-master of the Boston Girls' High and Latin
Schools‚ for many valuable criticisms; and to Principal
A. R. Crittenden, of the Ypsilanti High School, and to
Miss Helen B. Muir‚ assistant in ancient languages in this
institution, for assistance in reading the proof.
